# LangGraph and Langsmith application

## LangGraph:
LangGraph is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing language models. It provides a visual representation of the model's architecture, allowing you to understand how different components interact and contribute to the model's overall performance.

***Here are some key features of LangGraph:***

1. ***Visualizes model architecture:*** LangGraph creates interactive diagrams that illustrate the flow of data through the model, making it easier to understand complex models.
2. ***Analyzes model performance:*** You can use LangGraph to identify bottlenecks, areas of high computational cost, and potential areas for optimization.
3. ***Supports various model types:*** LangGraph works with a wide range of language models, including transformers, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.
4. ***Integrates with popular frameworks:*** LangGraph can be used with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## LangSmith:
LangSmith is a comprehensive platform for building and managing language models. It offers a variety of tools and features to help you develop, train, and deploy your own custom language models.

***Here are some key features of LangSmith:***

1. ***Data management:*** LangSmith provides tools for collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for training your language models.
2. ***Model training:*** You can use LangSmith to train your models on a variety of hardware and cloud platforms.
3. ***Model evaluation:*** LangSmith offers tools for evaluating your models' performance on different tasks and metrics.
4. ***Model deployment:*** Once your models are trained, you can deploy them to production environments using LangSmith's deployment tools.
5. ***Model collaboration:*** LangSmith facilitates collaboration between teams of data scientists and machine learning engineers.
6. ***Integration with popular frameworks:*** LangSmith integrates with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.


This application is a chatbot designed to interact with users. It starts by greeting the user, then proceeds to a conversation phase. The chatbot can potentially access external tools during the conversation. Finally, the interaction ends.
