# LangGraph and Langsmith application

#### LangGraph:
LangGraph is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing language models. It provides a visual representation of the model's architecture, allowing you to understand how different components interact and contribute to the model's overall performance.

***Here are some key features of LangGraph:***

1. ***Visualizes model architecture:*** LangGraph creates interactive diagrams that illustrate the flow of data through the model, making it easier to understand complex models.
2. ***Analyzes model performance:*** You can use LangGraph to identify bottlenecks, areas of high computational cost, and potential areas for optimization.
3. ***Supports various model types:*** LangGraph works with a wide range of language models, including transformers, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.
4. ***Integrates with popular frameworks:*** LangGraph can be used with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.




This application is a chatbot designed to interact with users. It starts by greeting the user, then proceeds to a conversation phase. The chatbot can potentially access external tools during the conversation. Finally, the interaction ends.
